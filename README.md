A simple password verification code based on Java

1.Enter the six digit password from the keyboard to verify whether the password is six digits. If it is not six digits, prompt the user to re-enter it until it is six digits;

2.Verify whether the password is correct. If you enter the password correctly within three times, welcome. Otherwise, the password is wrong. Please re-enter it (if the number of digits is wrong, it does not count as a loss of input opportunity).
